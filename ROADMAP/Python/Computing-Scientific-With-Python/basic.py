# Variables

#Variables are an essential part of Python and any programming language. A variable is a name that references or points to an object. You can declare a variable by writing the variable name on the left side of the assignment operator = and specifying the value to assign to that variable on the right side of the assignment operator:

variable_name = 'value'

#Create a variable called number and assign the value 5 to your new variable.


#Variables can store values of different data types. You just assigned an integer value, but if you want to represent some text, you need to assign a string. Strings are sequences of characters enclosed by single or double quotes, but you cannot start a string with a single quote and end it with a double quote or vice versa:

string_1 = "I am a string"
string_2 = 'I am also a string'
# string_3 = 'This is not valid"

#Delete your number variable and its value. Then, declare another variable called text and assign the string 'Hello World' to this variable.


# function print()

# You can use the built-in function print() to print the output of your code on the terminal.

# Functions are reusable code blocks that you can call, or invoke, to run their code when you need them. To call a function, you just need to write a pair of parentheses next to its name. You will learn more about functions very soon.

# For now, go to a new line and add an empty call to the print() function. You should not see any output yet.


#Each string character can be referenced by a numerical index. The index count starts at zero. So the first character of a string has an index of 0. For example, in the string 'Hello World', 'H' is at index 0, 'e' is at index 1, and so on.
