# Variables

#Variables are an essential part of Python and any programming language. A variable is a name that references or points to an object. You can declare a variable by writing the variable name on the left side of the assignment operator = and specifying the value to assign to that variable on the right side of the assignment operator:

variable_name = 'value'

#Create a variable called number and assign the value 5 to your new variable.


#Variables can store values of different data types. You just assigned an integer value, but if you want to represent some text, you need to assign a string. Strings are sequences of characters enclosed by single or double quotes, but you cannot start a string with a single quote and end it with a double quote or vice versa:

string_1 = "I am a string"
string_2 = 'I am also a string'
# string_3 = 'This is not valid"

#Delete your number variable and its value. Then, declare another variable called text and assign the string 'Hello World' to this variable.
